# knapsack-container-problem

Seetha works for an online store that uses air mail to send ordered products. But due to the covid-19
situation they have to ship the products using containers. Her task is to the determine the lowest cost way
to combine her orders for shipping. She has a list of product weights. The shipping company has a
requirement that all products loaded in a container must weigh less than or equal to 4 units plus the
weight of the minimum weight product. Otherwise they will not take responsibility for addresses getting
defaced. All products meeting that requirement will be shipped in one container.
You have to develop a program to find minimum number of containers required.
For example, there are products with weights w=[1,2,3,4,5,10,11,12,13]. This can be broken into two
containers: [1,2,3,4,5] and [10,11,12,13]. Each container will contain products weighing within 4 units of
the minimum weight product.
